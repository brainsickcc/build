The Brainsick code compiler (bscc) is an open source compiler for the
classic, pre‐.NET, Visual Basic (VB) language.  Specifically, we aim for
compatibility with the Visual Basic 6 (VB6) dialect.

This repository contains the build script, for easily building the
various components.  See the file INSTALL for instructions.
